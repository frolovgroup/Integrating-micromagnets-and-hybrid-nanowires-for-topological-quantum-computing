MuMax and Mathematica code for "Integrating micromagnets and hybrid nanowires for topological quantum computing" study.

The MuMax file contains all the raw data used, as well as some of the scripts used to generate it.

The Mathematica contains the implemented hybrid model notebook file. The Dragonfly.nb only consider this configuration, and the AllSetups.nb can be used to plot any of the given configurations. The TJunction.nb imports the calculated wavefunctions in the T-junction set-up for visualization.
