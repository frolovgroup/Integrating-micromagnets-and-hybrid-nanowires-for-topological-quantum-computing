Contains MuMax3 magnetic data and code, and Mathematica code for "Integrating micromagnets and hybrid nanowires for topological quantum computing" study.



The MuMax directory contains all the raw data used, as well as some of the scripts used to generate it. To run this requires the installation of the MuMax3 software package - https://mumax.github.io 


Mathematica directory
The Mathematica code contains the implemented hybrid model notebook files. The "Fig3_HybridDeviceModel_Majorana_ImportField_Dragonfly" only considers the single Dragonfly configuration and has more details on the calculations.
The other notebooks file names show the figures plotted from the script, and can be ran by downloading the whole repository and running the entire script sequnetially. 
Alternately one can go into the "Mathematica_out" folder which has the outputs with the named configurations.

The "Fig6_ImportWaveFunctions_T-junction.nb" imports the already calculated wavefunctions from the T-junction set-up for colour plot visualization.



The 3 magnet configuration MuMax data and mathematica notebook has another tested configuration not shown in the paper, it was another set-up constructed and measured experimnetally.
