MuMax magnetic data and code, and Mathematica code for "Integrating micromagnets and hybrid nanowires for topological quantum computing" study.



The MuMax file contains all the raw data used, as well as some of the scripts used to generate it. To run this requires the installation of the MuMax3 software package - https://mumax.github.io 


Mathematica
The Mathematica code contains the implemented hybrid model notebook files. The Dragonfly.nb only considers the single Dragonfly configuration, and the AllSetups.nb can be used to plot any of the given configurations, 
one needs to chose the correct options and commnent things in or out to change data sets

The TJunction.nb imports the calculated wavefunctions in the T-junction set-up for visualization.

The Mathematica_out is the folder for the outputs

The 3 magnet configuration MuMax data and mathematica notebook has another tested configuration not shown in the paper.
