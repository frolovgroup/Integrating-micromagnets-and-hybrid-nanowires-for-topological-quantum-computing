Contains MuMax3 magnetic data and code, and Mathematica code for "Integrating micromagnets and hybrid nanowires for topological quantum computing" study.



The MuMax directory contains all the raw data used, as well as some of the scripts used to generate it. To run this requires the installation of the MuMax3 software package - https://mumax.github.io 


Mathematica directory -

The Mathematica folder contains the implemented hybrid model and processing notebook files, the Mathematica_out subdirectory is where plots and ouput data goes. The "Fig3_HybridDeviceModel_Majorana_ImportField_Dragonfly" only considers the single Dragonfly configuration and has more details on the calculations as a guide.
The other notebooks file names show the figures plotted from the manuscript, and can be run by downloading the whole repository (including the Mumax3 data) and running the entire script sequnetially. 
Alternately one can go into the "Mathematica_out" folder which has the outputs with the named configurations.

The "Fig6_ImportWaveFunctions_T-junction.nb" imports the already calculated wavefunctions from the T-junction set-up for colour plot visualization.

FigS10 notebook allows one to view the magnetic field around and inside the nanowire for a single Dragonfly.

The 3 magnet configuration MuMax data and mathematica notebook has another tested configuration not shown in the paper, it was another set-up constructed and measured experimnetally.
